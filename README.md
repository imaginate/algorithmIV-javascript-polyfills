# Cure Your JS Environment!

#### Cure.js is a collection of JavaScript polyfills that help ensure your web environment is cross-browser compatible and your JavaScript engine executes properly.

#### Note: At the moment Cure.js only includes polyfills for a small portion of the native JavaScript objects (specifically the functionality used in [imaginate](https://github.com/imaginate)'s other projects). The only object's functionality that has been completely filled is the [console](https://github.com/imaginate/cure/blob/master/dev/parts/console.js).


## Getting Started
For a stand-alone browser environment:
- Download [cure.min.js](https://github.com/imaginate/cure/blob/master/src/cure.min.js)
- Before any other scripts add ``` <script src="cure.min.js"></script> ``` to your HTML's ``` head ``` or ``` body ```

For an AMD browser environment:
- Download [cure.min.js](https://github.com/imaginate/cure/blob/master/src/cure.min.js)
- Use ``` require('cure') ```

For a Node.js environment:
- Run ``` $ npm install curejs ```
- Use ``` require('cure') ```
